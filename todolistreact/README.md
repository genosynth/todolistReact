# TodoList
A To-Do List application created with React that lets the user add,edit,delete and mark tasks as complete.

## Technologies used

**NODE** 

**REACT** for creating and running the client side of the application.

**BOOTSTRAP** for creating an easy smooth layout with its pre-saved classes.


## Set Up 

1. First and foremost check whether you have node installed by running 

```
node -v
```

You should get the version of node if it is already installed, else you have to install node from https://nodejs.org/en/ which should take a couple of minutes only.

2. Open up a terminal in your chosen directory and run the following command assuming you have Git installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/genosynth/todolistReact.git 

```

3. Once the repo is cloned navigate into the folder and run the following command to install the dependencies.

```
npm i
```

4. Once all dependencies are installed run the "npm start" command to launch.
```
npm start 
```

5. You can now go to http://localhost:3000/ and you will be able to access the website.
